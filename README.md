# Registration and Login Authentication in Spring Boot
This repo is a simple example of how to use the Spring Security authentication mechanism to authenticate users.

It comprise of Registration and Login pages. The registration page is a simple form that allows users to register while the login page is a form that allows users to login.

# Setup ğŸ› 
To run this example, you need to have a database configured. In this case, we will use a relational database. i.e MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, etc.

I prefer to use PostgreSQL as it is a popular open source database. You can use your favorite database or create your own ğŸ˜œ.

> Change the database name, username and password in the `application.properties` file.

# Run the application ğŸš€
Run the application like any other Java application.ğŸ˜‚

Happy coding!ğŸ¤—
